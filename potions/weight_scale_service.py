BLE Weight Scale Service


* Author(s): Jeff Deville, altering Dan Halbert for Adafruit Industries Heart Rate Service

The Weight Scale Service is specified here:
https://www.bluetooth.com/wp-content/uploads/Sitecore-Media-Library/Gatt/Xml/Services/org.bluetooth.service.weight_scale.xml

Implementation Notes
--------------------

**Hardware:**

* Adafruit CircuitPython firmware for the supported boards:
  https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/releases
* Adafruit's BLE library: https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_BLE
